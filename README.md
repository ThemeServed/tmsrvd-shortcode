# tmsrvd-shortcode
Plugin from themeserved.com.
WordPress shortcode plugin, based on Bootstrap's best features. Lightened, to be fast. No bloated Bootstrap stuff, only necessary things. Best used with our themes, but you can freely fork it, chop it, use it, but do not abuse it. Enjoy :) 

## Requirements
The plugin is tested to work with WordPress 4.0 and higher.

## Shortcode Reference
* Columns
* Buttons
* Collapsibles
* Alets
* Tabs

## Usage
Repo contains gulp cofiguration file, so after running gulp command you'll get distribution folder on this path:
  
  /ts-framework/dist/wp-content/plugins/tmsrvd-shortcodes
  
Now, you can easy add your WordPress installation to dist folder. 

P.S. Do not forget to submit bugs to github issues, so we can react fast. Thanks for this!
